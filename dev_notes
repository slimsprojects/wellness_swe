12/15/2020 Start of wellness_swe 

- figuring out format for project
    - simple:
        - daily use at the end of the day
        - questions asked in a row, answer
        - analysis once every week
            - IDEA: use zader sentiment analysizer to get sentiment scores of conclusions

- adding initial data keys
    - hours of sleep
        - user input handling
    - rested (y/n)
        - user input handling
    - hours of exercise 
        - user input handling
    - amount (cups) of water
        - user input handling
    
    - conclusions
        - How did you feel today?
        - How productive were you today? (scale 1-10)
        - Additional notes
        


12/16/2020 

- created github
    - https://github.com/slimsprojects/wellness_swe


- where to store data?
    - csv?
    - database:
        - sqlite3 db 
            - wellness_swe_DB:
            - table:
                - date and time (auto?)
                - sleep
                - rested 
                - exercise 
                - water

- what kind of analysis on data?



12/17/2020

- moved db SQL code to its own script (db_wellness_swe.py) 

- IDEA: use machine learning to predict and suggest
    - based off hydration levels, amount of sleep from previous night, too much exercise
    - suggestions: extra hydration, naps, no exercise, fruits/ snacks

- wrote sqlite insert and fetch_all, delete_all functions

TO DO:
- add user menu for db_wellness_swe.py 
- allow edit to entries 
- make backup


12/18/2020

- database CRUD menu 
    - Add
        - entry input by category 
            - entry menu
            - how to not interfere/ work seemlessly with main wellness_swe.py script
            - quick and easy to use
    * View
        - view all: fetch_all
        - view selected entry:
            - by id 
    * Edit 
        - edit entry
        - How? 
            - enter id to edit
            - check if id exist in db 
            - ask which value to update
            - update value
    - Delete
        - delete all (caution)
        - delete selected 

- check if exist function

IDEA:
 - query and view data
        - swe per day
            - average per day
        - swe relation to conclusions

- (?) in db_wellness_swe.py #CREATE functions 
    - run main script wellness_swe.py 



12/23/20

- create functions
    ideas:
    - add entry menu (select what to add)
        - grab datetime 
    -
